# Docker Compose Remote Action

This action packs contents of the action workspace into archive.
Logs into remote host via ssh. Unpacks the workspace there and runs `docker compose up -d` command.

* `docker_compose_filename` - Path to the docker-compose file in the repository. Default is `docker-compose.yml`.
* `docker_args` - Docker compose arguments. Default is `-d --remove-orphans --build`.

# Usage example

Let's say we have a repo with single docker-compose file in it and remote
ubuntu based server with docker and docker-compose installed.

Setup a github-actions workflow (e.g. `.github/workflows/main.yml`):

```
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: 5eqn/docker-compose-remote-action@master
      name: Docker-Compose Remote Deployment
      with:
        ssh_host: example.com
        ssh_user: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_USERNAME }}
        ssh_private_key: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY }}
        ssh_host_public_key: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_PUBLIC_KEY }}
        docker_compose_prefix: myapp
```
